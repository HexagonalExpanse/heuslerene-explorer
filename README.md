# Band Structure Exploration
This folder allows you to easily explore the band structures on a locally hosted web app, usually at http://127.0.0.1:8050/. To run, simply navigate to this folder and install the required libraries by running 

 <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt </code></pre> 

 After installing, you can call
 <pre><code>python explorer.py </code></pre>

to run the app. Once inside, a popup window will provide an explanation on how to use the app to search band structures. Finally, if our server is not down the website should also be hosted at https://bands.heuslerene.com.
